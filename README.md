## Work in Progress / TODO / Ideas

- Listview
  - ~~Resize Column~~
  - ~~Show selected row~~
  - ~~Defaut to 99/N % wide~~
  - ~~dotpath hitlist columns~~
  - ~~Sort by Column~~
  - ~~Server side default columns~~
  - ~~Column name formatting~~
  - ~~BUG: Cannot resize smaller then content ~~
  - listview code in own js file
  
- Formview
  - Use Template Form
    - ~~Simple~~
    - ~~Nested~~
    - Arrays
      - On an Empty form display a Single Empty array element
      - Should the contents be nested in the template or the template be nested in the contents?
